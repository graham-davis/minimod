#MiniMod Audio Unit Plugin
####Graham Davis - Music 256a - Homework 3

The MiniMod plugin is a polyphonic MIDI controlled modular synthesizer. The synth consists of 4 modules. 
Each module powers a different oscillator (sine, sawtooth, square and triangle respectively).
Pitch (tune) and level parameters can be altered for each oscilator individually. 

Future improvements include implementing the Perform tab to include an audio-visualizer, ability to add
more modules, and internal effects (reverb, echo, etc).
